#### Overview

It's interesting to see how Google Docs can provide real-time changes in their documents without conflicts. I decided to replicate it and I build Docs, a fully functional application with documents that allows modifications in real time for many users. Besides, it has many text styles to add. You can try it out in the demo link.
